# 📘 My Web Development Learning Journey with Harkirat Singh

This repository documents my journey through the Web Development course by **Harkirat Singh**, which is structured into two parts: **Cohort** and **DevCourse**.

## 👨‍🏫 About the Course

The course is divided into two main sections:

### 🧠 Cohort
The Cohort part is designed to build a habit of daily coding and consistency. It emphasizes:
- Writing code every day
- Building small-to-medium scale projects
- Developing a strong developer mindset
- Learning by doing rather than passively consuming content

### 📚 DevCourse
The DevCourse is a more in-depth and conceptual part of the journey. It focuses on:
- Understanding how systems work under the hood
- Writing clean, maintainable code
- Thinking through backend and frontend architecture
- Preparing for real-world development environments

## 📅 Why This Repo Exists

This repository serves as:
- A log of my progress through the course
- A place to store my notes and insights
- A reflection of my commitment to learn consistently and deeply
