// Importing required modules from Next.js server library
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from "next/server";

// Define the GET function to handle incoming requests
export function GET(req: NextRequest) {
    // Extract headers from the incoming request
    const headers = req.headers;

    // Retrieve the "authorization" header containing the token
    const authorizationHeader = headers.get("authorization");

    // Decode the JWT token to extract user information
    const decoded = jwt.decode(authorizationHeader, "SECRET_KEY");

    // Extract the user ID from the decoded token payload
    const userId = decoded.userId;

    // Simulate a database query to fetch the user's profile picture
    // Replace with actual database logic in production

    // Return a JSON response with the user's avatar URL
    return NextResponse.json({
        avatarUrl: "http://images.google.com/cat.png"
    });
}

// Workflow Explanation:
// 1. A GET request is sent to the server with an "authorization" header containing a JWT token.
// 2. The server extracts the headers from the request object and retrieves the "authorization" token.
// 3. The token is decoded using a secret key ("SECRET_KEY"), extracting user information (e.g., userId).
// 4. The userId from the decoded token can be used to perform additional operations, such as querying a database.
//    In this example, it is assumed that the user's profile picture URL is obtained through such a query.
// 5. The server responds with a JSON object containing the user's avatar URL.
//    This response can be used by the client application to display the user's profile picture.
