// Defining the `Article` component, which represents a dynamically routed page.
const Article = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      {/* Displaying a message explaining the dynamic routing setup */}
      hii there from Article ke anadar k andar wala page 
      mtlb localhost:3000/articles/_______ yaha pe jo ayega woh wla page

// Exporting the `Article` component as the default export to make it reusable in the application.
export default Article;

/*
Notes:
- The `[...articleId]` file structure in Next.js is used for dynamic catch-all routing. 
  - It captures any path segments following `/articles/` in an array `params.articleId`.
  - For example:
    - `localhost:3000/articles/tech` → `params.articleId = ["tech"]`
    - `localhost:3000/articles/2024/news` → `params.articleId = ["2024", "news"]`
- This allows us to handle multiple levels of dynamic routing, making the application more flexible.
- The message displayed in the `div` indicates to the user that the content is dynamic and 
  depends on the part of the URL following `/articles/`.

How this works in practice:
1. The route file name `[...articleId].tsx` enables this dynamic behavior.
2. You can access `params.articleId` in the component using `getServerSideProps` or `getStaticProps` 
   (if needed for server-side or static generation).
3. You can use the captured segments to fetch data, render content, or display specific information 
   for the dynamic path provided in the URL.

This structure is commonly used in Next.js for pages like blogs, articles, or profiles, 
where the content depends on the URL path.
